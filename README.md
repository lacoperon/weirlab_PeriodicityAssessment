# Periodicity Assessment for genes in organisms under stress

In this project, I'm analyzing and quantifying the nucleotide periodicity for
both *E. coli* and *H. sapiens* in genes shown to have differential transcription
and/or translation under stress, relative to a bootstrap control.

## Data Sources

### *H. sapiens*

The dataset of human coding sequences (hereafter referred to as 'CDS') was
gleaned from the Ensembl website, accessible as of February 28th, 2018 at
[this FTP portal](ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/fasta/homo_sapiens/cds).

The data file `riboseq_mRNA_deandreev.csv` was obtained from the supplemental
files of [this paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0651-z),
which is on the topic of the effect of oxygen and glucose deprivation on gene
transcription and translation in *H. sapiens*.

### *E. coli*
