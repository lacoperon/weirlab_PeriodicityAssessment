# Periodicity Assessment for genes in organisms under stress

In this project, I'm analyzing and quantifying the nucleotide periodicity for
both *E. coli* and *H. sapiens* in genes shown to have differential transcription
and/or translation under stress, relative to a bootstrap control.

## Data Sources

### *H. sapiens*

The dataset of human coding sequences (hereafter referred to as 'CDS') was
gleaned from the Ensembl website, accessible as of February 28th, 2018 at
![this FTP portal](ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-91/fasta/homo_sapiens/cds).

### *E. coli*

To come...
